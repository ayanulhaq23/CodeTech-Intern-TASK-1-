### Project Explanation

*To-Do List Web Application*

The To-Do List Web Application is a simple and intuitive tool designed to help users manage their daily tasks effectively. The core functionality includes adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, and deleting tasks. The application ensures that tasks persist between sessions using the browser's local storage.

*Key Features:*
- *Add Task:* Users can enter a new task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list.
- *Complete Task:* Clicking on a task marks it as completed, visually represented by a line-through style.
- *Delete Task:* Each task has a "Delete" button that removes the task from the list.
- *Local Storage:* The application saves tasks in local storage, ensuring they are retained even after the browser is closed and reopened.

*Technology Stack:*
- *HTML:* The backbone of the application, providing the basic structure including the input field, button, and task list.
- *CSS:* Enhances the visual appeal, making the application clean and user-friendly.
- *JavaScript:* Powers the interactivity, handling task addition, completion, deletion, and local storage functionality.

*Future Enhancements:*
To further improve the functionality and user experience, consider adding features such as:
- *Task Editing:* Allow users to edit existing tasks.
- *Due Dates:* Add the ability to assign due dates to tasks.
- *Priority Levels:* Enable users to set priority levels for tasks.
- *UI/UX Improvements:* Introduce animations and more sophisticated styling for a better user experience.

This project showcases a practical use of web development skills, combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and useful application.
